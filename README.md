Blackjack GUI game

**Description**

This project is part of the coursework requirements for Rice University's Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python course. Using the _simplegui_ library, we build an interactive game where a user can play a BlackJack game against a computer. 

This coursework challenges the student to use object-oriented programming, building a GUI, and how to import images into a GUI program.
